# LED_Lights
LED Lightstrip project controlled by arduino.

Yes, I know I spelt receive wrong when I made the file. Whoops.

IoT light strip designed to change color based on the input from the website.

The website backend is written in Python Flask. The arduino website is written in C/C++. The website front end is made with HTML and CSS. 

Currently the light strip is trying to work with serial.
